            Post Moves is the name for the evolving musical output by NY-based multi-instrumentalist Sam Wenc.  Today's show marks the release of his latest album, "No Dignity in Haste" released by Louisville-based label Obsolete Staircases.  The album is his first foray into solo guitar compositions; embodying the avant-garde hillybilly philosophies of Henry Flynt, with additional cues from the likes Jack Rose, Tom Ze, and Olivier Messiaen.
