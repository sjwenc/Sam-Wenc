        <p>Wedged right between the luddite folkisms of Jack Rose and the modal movements of Jim O'Rourke, you might find Post Moves. Through a collection of full lengths and exploratory EPs, Post Moves have walked the line between form and formless work. On their latest album, we still hear Sam Wencâ€™s obsession with ethereal slide guitars and with rambling stories-as-song. In Boogie Night, we find a bigger palette of sounds; harmoniums, bells, and choruses abound. Finding himself deep within the mantric (and manic) music of Tony Conrad, Sir Richard Bishop, and Susan Alcorn, Wenc pulls at the disquieting aspects of American music. He stretches the confines of the pedal steel guitar to suss out the more textural & tonal elements of the instrument; it's restorative and transfixing, putting the work more in the camp of ambient than anything else. Ultimately, Post Moves make Americana about an America that makes no sense; pastoral, shambling and strange.</p>
