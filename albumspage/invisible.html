        "What I love about this piece from local duo RON is how much it moves
        and flows and evolves over its nearly 19-minute running time. While I’m
        all for a little stagnation and repetition in music, it’s obvious that
        Carl Laukkanen and Sam Wenc put a lot of care into making sure this work
        had some momentum to it, letting it move from a quaintly minimalist
        guitar/synth beginning into more glitchier territory. And it all wraps
        up in a triumphant symphony of drones. I feel energized and excited by
        this brilliant work."
